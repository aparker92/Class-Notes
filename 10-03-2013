Stochastic Models - like to put earthquakes into models 
	Earthquakes 6 and above
	Earthquakes in space and time
Marked Sochaistic Models
	Earthquakes in same places a lot no matter size, but big sizes are less frequent
	Poisson (special Gamma)
		model of things that don’t age
	ETAS - epidemic type aftershock
		one event can spawn other events (any number of children, only one parent)
Brownian Passage Time
	Brownian going until meet threshold
USGS 1999
	P(M>=6.7 event by 2030) = .7+-.1
	Interpretations
		In repeated trials, how often would this happen
		I believe more strongly that it will happen than not. 2 and ⅓ times more likely than it won’t
	How came to conclusion
		Stage 1
			How distance between two points is changing with time (how much ground is moving)
			Then look at geological shifts to see if done abruptly (by earthquake)
			Slip Factor - how much movement is accommodated aseismically
			Then model deviations by average values as Gaussian random variables
			Draw at random one of three generic relationships between seismic fault and moment (as in physics)
			Then find expected magnitude
			Repeat until 2000 times meet slip constraint
		Stage 2
			Fit 3 stochastic models for occurance and combine to estimate probability of large earthquake
	What’s wrong with this
		Not a Probability by any standard interpretation of probability
		Equate Frequencies to Probabilities
		No standard for equal probability assumptions and data not global
		Earthquake probability is a metaphor
		People argue about the rules of the game
AGU Article and Rebuttal 
	Urn models for natural disasters (black or white marbles)
	Different models
		Sampling with replacement
		Adding more marbles when no event occurs
	Rate does not mean that there is a probability - There is nothing random
	Point: assuming that there is an average time between failures doesn’t mean there is a probability distribution and many can be made with the same average time
Testing Predictions
	Need to show merit beyond just lucky
	Need a chance model for successful predictions: Does method succeed beyond chance
	Typically
		Model earthquakes to be stochaistic (estimated by historical rates) then hold the predictions fixed
		Then see how often predictions would have been right
		Could also deorganize it so times are different
	Issues with that
		Analogy to weather prediction
		Most schemes lose dependence of predictions on history
		Don’t account for clustering
		“If earthquake today, predict earthquake tomorrow” works well (like predicting rain)
		Can’t say know probability distribution/parameters of them - and predictions won’t change based on what see
		We need to find a way to test things without assuming earthquakes are random
Is there a permutation approach?
	Null: predictions not better than chance? or no better than simpler method?
	Need reasonable null hypothesis
	parimutuel payoff
